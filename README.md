# Introduction  
This repository contains my **Week 2 project** for the Developers Arena Data Science Internship.  
The task is to develop a **Student Grade Evaluation Program** that accepts marks as input and determines the student's grade using conditional statements.  

The project focuses on fundamental programming skills, including decision-making logic, input handling, and clean output formatting.

##  Objective  
- Take marks (0–100) as input  
- Categorize the marks into grade levels  
- Display a meaningful and motivational message for each grade  
- Improve Python fundamentals with practical implementation

# Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- Basic input/output  
- Conditional statements
